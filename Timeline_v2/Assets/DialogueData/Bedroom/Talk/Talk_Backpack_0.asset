  dialogue:
  - "Hey it\u2019s my backpack."
  - The backpack looks empty but it can hold a lot of stuff.
  - "Though last time I checked I still had my books in there from my last semester.\r"
  - Why clean it out? Do they not want me to have access to some music history books?
  - Talk about weird.
  - 'Well, I can use it to carry around anything useful. '
  - "That\u2019s probably better than just carrying everything around in my pockets."
  - 'Kind of makes me wish I had some magical way to make things disappear into an
    inventory. '
  - 'You know, like in classic video games? Seriously, where do they put that sword?
    inventory. '
  - "On second thought, maybe I don\u2019t want to know. "
  - '[New feature added! Inventory]'
