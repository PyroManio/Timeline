  - "Seriously, you don\u2019t know? I mean, you kind of have to know who they are
    to sign up for this thing, right?\r\n"
  - "But whatever. I\u2019ll tell you what I know."
  - "Pandora Laboratories is a company that\u2019s dedicated to achieving the best
    out of everybody."
  - They run all sorts of tests, from creating super athletes to drug testing, and
    even wacky things like alternative medicine!
  - "But what caught my eye was the Chromatic Project. \u201CAchieve enlightenment
    in less than a month!\u201D\r\n"
  - 'They went on to say they could supercharge your brain through the latest breakthroughs
    in science.

'
  - "Honestly, I did it to help myself out with my grades. I know it\u2019s stupid,
    but I\u2019m kind of desperate.\r\n"
  - "See, I have a hard time focusing on anything for a long period of time. And
    trust me, it\u2019s a lot worse than it sounds."
  - But I met with these guys yesterday and they said they could fix all of that
    through the Chromatic Project!
  - Of course, I got in a fight with my parents this morning about it.
  - Anyways, back on track.
  - "Apparently, they\u2019re centered somewhere in Germany, but they have labs practically
    all over the world!"
  - I saw a flyer for the Chromatic Project in the mall a few days ago.
  - They had a lab about 15 minutes from where I live, so I decided to check it out.
  - Of course, I only went there once for the initial interview.
  - The guys there seemed pretty professional, if a little bit stiff.
  - "Still, it\u2019s kind of amazing they set this all up in such a short amount
    of time."
  - "I don\u2019t remember them telling me about all THIS.\r\n"
  - Last thing I remember is getting the letter that I was accepted for the Chromatic
    Project
  - and then I went to bed for the night.
  - I guess the escape room thing is supposed to boost my mental acuity?
  - I wonder what other tests they have in store for me.
