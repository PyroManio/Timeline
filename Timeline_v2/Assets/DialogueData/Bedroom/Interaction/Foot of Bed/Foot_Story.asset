  - I always carried all my books around in my backpack when I was young.
  - Everyone else always told me my backpack weighed a ton. Maybe I just got used
    to it?
  - The weight also made for a good anti-theft strategy too, I guess.
  - "The reason was that I would always forget my books in class if I didn\u2019t
    have them on me."
  - "So, I just got used to carrying them around with me. That way I\u2019d never
    forget them."
  - I also carried around my laptop in there along with its charger.
  - That way I could do anything from homework to writing anywhere I wanted.
  - I was often at a lot of after-school activities when I was a kid, so I needed
    to be mobile.
  - I can still remember sitting backstage working on finishing an essay while I
    was running tech crew.
  - "Let\u2019s keep looking for clues."
