  dialogue:
  - The junk box is just where I throw random stuff in my pockets.
  - Some of it eventually makes its way into the trash can in the corner.
  - "Well, if I was gonna hide something useful in this room, it\u2019d probably
    be in here."
  - "Hey, looks like you were right! There\u2019s a screwdriver in here! Phillips
    head, by the way."
  - '[Screwdriver added to inventory]'
  - The rest of the stuff here is junk. Nothing of interest.
