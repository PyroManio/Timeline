  - "%0%I really don\u2019t use this chest much. It just holds my stuff for winter
    weather."
  - "%0%Even in wintertime, it\u2019s usually warm enough that we only need light
    jackets."
  - "%0%I like winter the best, actually. \n"
  - '%0%Better than having 90-degree weather for 6 months of the year.'
  - "%0%It does hold my scarves and holiday sweaters, though. \n"
  - '%0%And I usually have to wear them for Christmas.'
  - '%0%I also put my laundry baskets on top of it before I get around to folding
    my clothes.'
  - "%0%Which usually happens about\u2026 80 percent of the time.\n"
  - "%0%Okay maybe it\u2019s more like 50. But who enjoys folding laundry?\n"
