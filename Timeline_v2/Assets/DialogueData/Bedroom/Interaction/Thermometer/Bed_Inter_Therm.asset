  dialogue:
  - The thermometer is only really useful if we need to know the approximate temperature
    of the room.
  - It only works in blocks of 4. Below 60, 60-64, 64-68, 68-72, 72-76, 76-80, and
    above 80.
  - "It\u2019s Fahrenheit, by the way, in case you\u2019re not from the US or something."
  - "Looks like it\u2019s between 76 and 80 degrees right now. That\u2019s pretty
    normal, though."
