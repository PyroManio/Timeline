  dialogue:
  - "There\u2019s not much here. Dress clothes are on the left, and street clothes
    are on the right."
  - "The mirror is there to help me get dressed. I love that it\u2019s a full-body
    mirror."
  - "I use the dress clothes a lot for concerts and other events, but it\u2019s mostly
    stuff I never wear.\r\n"
  - "I should really throw out some of the stuff that doesn\u2019t fit anymore.\n"
  - "There\u2019s also a laundry hamper in here that I almost never use."
  - Normally I just start piling my dirty clothes in a corner. I should really stop
    doing that.
  - 'My shoe rack is also full to bursting. Which is ironic because I usually just
    wear one pair of shoes.

'
  - Again, I should probably throw some of this stuff out.
  - "Aside from that, junk is usually piled in the corners from old bedding and stuff.
    Looks like it\u2019s gone."
  - "There\u2019s also old kid toys and stuff on the top of the shelf, along with
    some hats and performance equipment.\r\n"
  - Yeah, now that I think about it, this closet has a whole lot more in here than
    I thought.
