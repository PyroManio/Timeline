  - "I used to write a lot when I was a kid. And I mean a LOT.\r"
  - "So far, I\u2019ve written over 500 pages of short stories, novels, and various
    works of fiction."
  - Single-spaced, 12-point font Times New Roman. None of that double-spacing bs.
  - Whenever I had free time in high school, you could usually find me working on
    some story.
  - I always stored them on my laptop. And I kept a few of them backed up on flash
    drives.
  - "\u2026God I hope that they\u2019re all still on there and that they weren\u2019t
    erased."
  - "I couldn\u2019t imagine what I\u2019d do if all of my work just up and disappeared.
    I\u2019d be crushed."
