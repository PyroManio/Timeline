  - "%0%Ah, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll explain."
  - "%0%So the whole thing is that there\u2019s this cat, and he\u2019s put inside
    of a box."
  - "%0%Once the cat is inside, there\u2019s absolutely no way to observe the cat.
    Be it sight, sound, or touch."
  - '%2%Inside the box is a bottle of poison that will ultimately kill the cat. '
  - "%0%The bottle is sealed when the test starts, but there\u2019s a way to break
    it open with a device. "
  - "%0%This device is triggered by detecting Uranium. Conveniently, there\u2019s
    a molecule of Uranium inside."
  - '%0%Uranium has a half-life of approximately 1 hour.'
  - "%0%Basically, that means that after 1 hour, there\u2019s a 50 percent chance
    that the Uranium will have decayed."
  - "%0%Basically, that means that after 1 hour, there\u2019s a 50 percent chance
    that the Uranium will have decayed."
  - '%2%When it decays, the device will trigger and break the bottle of poison, killing
    the cat.'
  - "%0%So, you put the cat in the box and wait an hour. So, here\u2019s the big
    question."
  - '%0%After an hour, is the cat dead or alive?'
  - "%0%This is where things start to get weird, because there\u2019s an equal chance
    the cat is alive or dead."
  - '%1%The problem is, each is equally likely, and you have no way of telling which
    is which.'
  - "%1%After all, the cat can\u2019t be observed. So, you can\u2019t accurately
    claim that the cat is either one."
  - "%8%It can\u2019t be alive, because it could be dead, and it can\u2019t be dead,
    because it could be alive. "
  - "%8%So, what do you say to describe it? That\u2019s where a concept called superposition
    comes in."
  - '%8%It resolves this problem by saying the cat is both alive and dead at the
    same time.'
  - '%8%More scientifically, the cat is in a superposition of being alive and dead.'
  - '%8%So, the cat is both alive and dead and neither and both at the same time.'
  - "%0%I know it\u2019s confusing, but superposition is weird. It does all sorts
    of crazy things."
  - '%0%But this construct is fragile. As soon as you open the box, the superposition
    collapses'
  - '%0%and you find out if the cat is either alive or dead.'
