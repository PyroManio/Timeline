  - "%0%Anyway, let\u2019s see what\u2019s on this computer."
  - "%0%\u2026!"
  - "%0%There\u2019s two text files on here."
  - "%0%One says, \u201CTo survive you must confess your sins. Reveal thy secrets,
    prisoner.\u201D"
  - "%0%I can\u2019t open the other one. But it looks like I can connect to the printer
    and print it out."
  - "%0%I printed it and it reads\u2026 LIES?"
  - '%0%And what the hell does the first file mean?'
  - "%0%It\u2026 doesn\u2019t mean that literally\u2026 does it?"
  - "%0%Look, I get that you\u2019re trying to test me, but I\u2019m not sharing
    the darkest corners of my mind.\r\n"
  - "%0%I\u2019ve made promises to people to keep their secrets. And I plan to take
    those secrets to my grave."
  - "%0%I\u2019ll play along, but only to the extent that\u2019s necessary."
  - "%0%Besides\u2026 there are some things people are better off not knowing."
  - "%0%Sorry, that got kind of dark there, huh? Let\u2019s just move on from this."
