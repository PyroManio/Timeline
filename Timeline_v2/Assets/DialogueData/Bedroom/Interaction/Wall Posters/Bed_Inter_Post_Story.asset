  - "The \u201CSING\u201D sign was hung there by my aunt. She\u2019s the one that
    helped redecorate this place."
  - This is also the only room in the house that has a different color wall since
    we painted it.
  - The skyline poster I got on a trip to New York. Man, that trip was blazing hot.
  - "We found it after stopping at one of these young artist\u2019s shops. "
  - It was a fun trip. We went with my theater company and we saw a lot of shows.
  - "We walked a LOT though. Something I\u2019d prefer never to have to do again."
  - "The other one was just a poster my aunt found cute. It\u2019s just some generic
    movie picture."
  - "It says, \u201CIn life, there is no take two.\u201D With a number 7 on it. "
  - "And then there\u2019s my coat rack. It\u2019s something someone picked up in
    Africa. I forget who though.\r\n"
  - "It\u2019s metal and depicts some African guys in what looks like a jazz band.\r\n"
  - "Complete with guitar, trumpet, percussion, and some African woodwind I can\u2019t
    identify."
  - "In case you couldn\u2019t tell, I\u2019m pretty into music and the performing
    arts.\r\n"
