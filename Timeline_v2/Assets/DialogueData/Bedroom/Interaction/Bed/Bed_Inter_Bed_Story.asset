  - "Ah, this is my bed. It\u2019s also where I woke up when I started this whole
    thing."
  - "Huh? My bed? I mean, yeah. It\u2019s my bed. What else do you want?"
  - 'Well, I guess there is some stuff about it. '
  - "When I was little, I never really slept in my own bed. I slept in my parent\u2019s
    bed.\r\n"
  - 'But eventually I had to grow out of it. They started making me sleep in my own
    bed.

'
  - 'I used to have a bunk bed for when my friends came over.

'
  - But after middle school, I got this bed.
  - "That\u2019s when\u2026 I started feeling like something was in the corner of
    my room."
  - "Ever since then, there have been nights where I can\u2019t sleep well on that
    thing."
  - "It just\u2026 wasn\u2019t comfortable. But I just told myself it was all in
    my head."
  - "\u2026Right?"
